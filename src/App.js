/*
Vitanova - Merged Frontend & Simulated Backend
- The original Node.js backend logic is simulated using mock API functions that persist data in the browser's localStorage.
- This creates a fully interactive, client-side application without needing a separate server or database.
- It features distinct user roles (Student and Counselor) with different dashboards and permissions.
- All original features like screenings, bookings, forums, and video libraries are functional.
- New Feature: Added a multi-step sign-up process with OTP verification simulation.
- Emergency Feature: Added an SOS button, location sharing, and local emergency contacts.
- UI/UX Update: Collapsible navigation for a focused view.
- New Feature: AI Chatbot "Neura" for assistance and FAQs.
- New Feature: Daily check-in and weekly screening reminders.
- UI Update: Applied new calming color scheme and custom logo.
- Dark Theme Update: Implemented a new slate blue color palette for a modern look.
- New Feature: Added a daily inspirational quote to the student dashboard.
- New Feature: Added validation for email and phone numbers during signup and password reset.
- Update: Replaced the monthly calendar with a simplified "Today/Tomorrow" selector for appointments.
- Fix: Improved the error message when a user tries to sign up with an existing email.
